        "\n",
        "1. **Binding Affinity**: The three-dimensional arrangement of atoms in a molecule determines its ability to bind to specific receptors or enzymes in a biological system. Small changes in the structure can significantly alter the binding affinity, directly influencing the drug’s potency.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **Solubility and Permeability**: The functional groups and overall geometry of the molecule affect its solubility in water or lipids, which impacts the drug's absorption and distribution across cell membranes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Stability and Metabolism**: Structural features determine how easily a drug is metabolized by enzymes in the liver or other tissues. Certain molecular configurations may be more resistant to degradation, resulting in a longer duration of action, while others are quickly broken down and excreted.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Toxicity**: Some structural motifs can lead to unwanted side effects or toxicity. Understanding the structure-property relationship helps in designing safer drugs with fewer side effects.\n",
        "\n",
        "In cheminformatics, SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) is a widely used notation for describing the structure of chemical compounds. However, to better understand the structure of a molecule, it can be useful to visualize the molecule as a graph, where atoms are represented as nodes and chemical bonds as edges.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Steps?\n",
        "In this section, you will follow:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **SMILES to Molecule Conversion**: We will use RDKit to convert a SMILES string into a molecular object. RDKit is a powerful toolkit that provides tools for chemical informatics, including functions to parse SMILES strings.\n",
        "  \n",
        "2. **Molecule to Graph**: After converting the SMILES string into a molecular object, we will transform this molecule into a graph. In the graph, each atom will be a node, and each bond will be an edge.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Visualization**: Finally, we will use `networkx` to visualize the graph structure. Each atom will be labeled with its atomic symbol, and edges between atoms will represent the bonds in the molecule.\n"

        "Graph-level supervised learning refers to the problem of classifiying/predicting entire graphs (in contrast to nodes), given a **dataset of graphs**, based on some structural graph properties.

Unlike traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that operate on grid-like data (such as images), GCNs are designed to generalize the convolution operation to the graph domain. This makes them powerful tools for tasks such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we explored the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for drug response prediction, focusing on predicting IC50 values across various cancer cell lines. Through the integration of molecular graphs (representing drugs) and gene expression data (representing cancer cell lines), we demonstrated the effectiveness of GNN-based models in capturing complex relationships between drug structure and cancer cell behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key takeaways from this notebook include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Data Processing**: We processed the GDSC2 dataset, combining drug features (derived from SMILES) and cancer cell line features (derived from gene expression data) to build a robust dataset for drug response prediction.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Model Training**: We trained a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to predict the drug response (IC50 values) for different cancer cell lines. By treating each drug as a graph, the GNN was able to learn intricate molecular relationships that influence drug efficacy.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Baseline Comparison**: The GNN model's performance was compared to a baseline model (Lasso regression). The GNN outperformed Lasso in terms of key metrics such as RMSE and R², demonstrating its superior ability to model the interactions between drugs and cell lines.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Model Evaluation**: Visualizations of predicted vs. true IC50 values for specific cancer types showed that the GNN model provides more accurate predictions, closely matching the true drug responses.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **GNN Model**: Achieved strong predictive performance by leveraging molecular graph structures, capturing complex drug-cell interactions that other linear models (such as Lasso) may miss.\n",
        "- **Baseline Model**: Although Lasso is a reliable model for simpler prediction tasks, it was outperformed by the GNN model, highlighting the benefits of using deep learning models for drug response prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful approach for drug response prediction, outperforming traditional models like Lasso in this task. The ability of GNNs to model molecular structures as graphs allows for a more nuanced understanding of drug efficacy, making them a promising tool in precision oncology and pharmacogenomics. This work demonstrates the potential of GNNs in drug discovery, where accurate prediction of drug response is critical for developing targeted cancer therapies.\n",
